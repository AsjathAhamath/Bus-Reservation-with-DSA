# Bus-Reservation-with-DSA
The system lets customers register, search buses, reserve seats, and join a waiting list. It applies DSA using a queue for fair waiting-list handling and a stack for managing recent actions. Arrays store reservations, and sorting algorithms organize customer data. Admins manage buses and bookings efficiently.
